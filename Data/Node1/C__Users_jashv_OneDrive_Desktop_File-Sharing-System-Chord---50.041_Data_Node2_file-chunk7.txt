The ritual was performed that night. Under the light of the full moon, Lysandra stood in the center of the stone circle as the Elders chanted in a language long forgotten. The air crackled with power, and the ground beneath her feet trembled. As the final words were spoken, a brilliant light enveloped Lysandra, and in an instant, she was gone.

Her sacrifice sealed the darkness once more, and Elysia was saved.

But as the Elders had foretold, the darkness would rise again one day. And when that day came, the people of Elysia would have to face it without their beloved queen.

For now, though, the kingdom thrived, and Lysandra's name was etched into the annals of history as the queen who had given everything to protect her people. And her story, passed down through generations, became a legend that would never be forgotten.
