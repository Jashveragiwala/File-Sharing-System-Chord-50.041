mprisoned by those who came before, but the seal was never meant to last forever. The time of its awakening draws near."

Lysandra clenched her fists, feeling a cold dread settle in her stomach. "Is there no way to stop it?"

"There is," the Elder replied, "but the cost will be great. To stop the darkness, a life must be given willingly — a life tied to the kingdom itself."

Taryn’s face paled, and the warriors exchanged uneasy glances. But Lysandra didn’t hesitate. She knew what the Elders meant. The life they required was hers.

"I will give my life," Lysandra said, her voice steady. "If it means saving my people, I will pay the price."

The Elders nodded slowly. "Very well. But know this, Queen of Elysia: your sacrifice will not erase the darkness, only delay it once more. One day, it will rise again, and when it does, there will be no stopping it."

Lysandra accepted the fate without fear. If her sacrifice could buy her people even a few more centuries of peace, then it was worth it.
